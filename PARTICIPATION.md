# How to Volunteer for the Workathon

This assumes you have done all logistical steps prior to the first day of the Workathon as specified via email.

## Step 1: Login to Econjobmarket

Go to [https://support.econjobmarket.org/user/login](https://support.econjobmarket.org/user/login) and log in with the credentials you received over email (if participating, you will have received these prior to the Workathon).

You should then see your username appear on screen. If this happens, you are logged in!

## Step 2: Pick an institution

TODO: change to applicant database page

Go to [https://support.econjobmarket.org/institutions](https://support.econjobmarket.org/institutions) and click on any number beside the name of an institution in the table (e.g. Harvard University has a 350 beside it, UBC has a 57 beside it).

You should then see a big list of departments inside the institution, which completes this step.

## Step 3: Find the missing entries for a department in that institution

TODO: change to missing entries, mention all shortcuts

On the page you just found, there should be a list of multiple "departments" (e.g. Vancouver School of Economics, Sauder School of Business, etc). Underneath each are two links: "Graduates with outcomes" and "Graduates with no outcomes". Click on "Graduates with no outcomes".

If you do not see any names appear, skip that department and keep going. Otherwise, you should see a list of names and years.

Click on one. This should bring up a page that says "Candidate has no recorded outcomes".

Most likely the person you clicked will have an institution at the top of their page, which is the one they graduated from. Using a search engine, look up the person's name (and optionally together with their graduating institution) and try to look for the institution they got hired at after completing their Ph.D.

If you find one, click "Add another outcome" and fill out the resulting form.

## Step 4: Fill the placement form for each person you find

First, type the name of the hiring institution you just found in the previous step into the first bar (Choose the ejm organization id...). 

If no institutions show up, type in `893` and put the name of the institution under "Notes".

Next, under position type, put the type of job the person was hired at. 

Put the year of hire in "Choose the year the job started", and finally link the URL you found the information from under "Source".

If you have any additional notes you need to add, put them under "Notes".

When you finish, click "Update the applicants outcome" at the bottom. If you ever need to edit a placement you made, open "Graduates with outcomes", find the name of the person you want to update, click it and then click "Edit this outcome" under the specific outcome you want to change (it should be one with your username on it).

## Step 5: Repeat!

Do this for as many people as you can over the course of the Workathon.
