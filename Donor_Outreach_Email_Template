Dear VSE Faculty,
 
 
Hope this email finds you well.
 
We, Alex Dong, Soren Rajani, Jin Wang, and James Yu, are undergraduate students at the Vancouver School of Economics and currently work as Research Assistants to Professor Michael Peters. We wanted to let you know about a fundraiser (Workathon for Solidarity, “W4S”) that is currently taking place in the VSE community. The workathon started on Friday, July 2 and will end on Sunday, July 4, PDT. We will be accepting donations through Showpass from now until the end of July 9. 


The main objective of W4S is to raise awareness and funds for anti-discrimination causes (supporting Indigenous peoples, Asian American & Pacific Islander communities, 2SLGBTQ+ communities, and self-identified women & children in need). A team of around fifty volunteers along with us are contributing all our time within the three-day period to build up a dataset on EconJobMarket.org, which tracks placement outcomes for Economics Ph.D. graduates around the world. After the first day, we have generated around 1,500 data entries. You can see students’ progress at http://sage.microeconomics.ca, note that there is a slight delay in updating the entries to the website page, the actual amount of new entries is over 1,500.


We are writing to you to let you know that we have also provided a platform for you to financially contribute to the causes if you'd like. Please check out https://www.showpass.com/vse-workathon/ for donation information (we offer a variety of donation choices from $99 to $999). 


You could also donate directly with any amount that you’d like using the following links:
Indian Residential School Survivors Society: http://bit.ly/w4s-irsss
Downtown Eastside Women’s Centre: http://bit.ly/w4s-dewc
Stop AAPI Hate: http://bit.ly/w4s-aapi
Egale Canada: http://bit.ly/w4s-egale
When you choose to donate directly on the websites of the above organizations, if you can, please email us your donation receipts at workathonforsolidarity@gmail.com so that we can calculate the total amount of funds raised. 

In addition to the invaluable impact you will directly be making on the lives of First Nations peoples, AAPI communities, 2SLGBTQ+ communities, and self-identified women and children in need, we will add your name to our Donor Appreciation page if you would like. We hope that the project, bolstered with your support, will contribute to an ongoing conversation here at the Vancouver School of Economics and the university community at large focusing on issues of race, ethnicity, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, and intersectionality, in particular, the impacts they have on students, faculty, and staff members. 
            
Thank you very much.
 
Alex, Soren, Jin, and James
