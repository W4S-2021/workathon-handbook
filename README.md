# Workathon for Solidarity 2021

We are a group of alumni and undergraduates at the Vancouver School of Economics, as research assistants to [@michaelpetersubc](https://github.com/michaelpetersubc).

Following [the initiatives driven by our fellow alumni Amedeus D'Souza and Felipe Grosso last summer](https://twitter.com/W4S_2020), and in light of recent tragedies around the globe caused by systemic discrimination (add more specifics here?), we have stepped up to continue the movement against racism, misogyny, homophobia, and transphobia, all of which have led to countless preventable acts of violence.

While we acknowledge once again that our actions alone are not enough to overcome these challenges, we hope our efforts will continue to open up vital conversations and spark further initiatives to work towards a more inclusive future.

## What We're Doing

Over the course of three days in July (July 2 - 4), we will be doing another "Workathon" to add to the EconJobMarket (EJM) dataset which was built up in the Workathon last year. Once again, we will work for about 10 hours a day, manually collecting and developing this dataset.

Once we finish, we will donate all our wages for the three day Workathon to many amazing causes, including (insert causes here).

We would like that as many people:
1. match our donation, and
2. listen to those most affected by discrimination to strive for the acceptance of everyone regardless of the color of their skin, their gender, or their sexual orientation

Most importantly, we want to draw attention to issues of race, gender, and intersectionality, in particular, the impacts they have on students, faculty, and staff members, which must be evaluated by all of us. 

We hope that the Workathon, like last year's, will help with this process.
