# Workathon for Solidarity 2021

The Workathon for Solidarity was originally initiated by UBC VSE students Amedeus D’souza and Felipe Grosso in 2020 to promote awareness for anti-discrimination causes by working on Econ Job Market’s (EJM) dataset for around 10 hours a day, manually collecting and developing EJM’s dataset. You can find more information about last year’s event here: [https://economics.ubc.ca/news/2020/vse-students-to-hold-workathon-to-raise-funds-for-anti-racist-queer-causes/#.YLf7ui2z1EI](https://economics.ubc.ca/news/2020/vse-students-to-hold-workathon-to-raise-funds-for-anti-racist-queer-causes/#.YLf7ui2z1EI)

To continue with the efforts of building a more united community, we decided to run another Workathon this year. Recent events have compelled us to take action against the multifaceted nature of racism and misogyny, which, even in its most subtle forms, contribute to conditions that permit overt discrimination and violence to occur. Although these challenges cannot be overcome within the span of a single news cycle, donation or event, we hope to contribute to a vital conversation. All donations received will be given to the following three organizations:

- Indian Residential School Survivors Society, [https://www.irsss.ca/](https://www.irsss.ca/)
- Downtown Eastside Women’s Centre, [https://dewc.ca/](https://dewc.ca/)
- Stop AAPI Hate, [https://stopaapihate.org/](https://stopaapihate.org/)

We, Alex Dong, James Yu, Jin Wang, and Soren Rajani, are students at the Vancouver School of Economics and currently work as research assistants to Professor Michael Peters. We want to draw attention to issues of race, ethnicity, gender, and intersectionality, in particular, the impacts they have on students, faculty, and staff members, which must be discussed and evaluated by all of us. Hopefully, the Workathon project will help that process.

To increase awareness for the anti-discrimination causes, we will be recruiting volunteers to work on EJM’s dataset together for the three-day event. The volunteers will mainly be recruited from the Economics discipline at the University of British Columbia, along with some high school students. All participants of the Workathon are encouraged to collect as many data entries as they can. The joint efforts of the students will lead to a stronger positive impact over the community. 

To raise as many funds as we can for the organizations, we will be promoting the event with the help of UBC media. We, along with Professor Peters, will also be reaching out to potential donors (including faculty members, local businesses, and international corporations) who may be interested in supporting our causes.

To conclude, by running the Workathon this year, we aim to fundraise for organizations that work to support First Nations peoples, Asian American and Pacific Islander communities, and women in need; and to complete a database that students and alumni can use to guide their plans for a career in economics.
