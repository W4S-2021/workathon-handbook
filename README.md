# Workathon for Solidarity 2021

The Workathon for Solidarity is an event initiated by UBC VSE students Amedeus D’souza and Felipe Grosso in 2020 to promote awareness on and raise funds for anti-discrimination causes by working on Econ Job Market’s (EJM) Ph.D. placement dataset for around 10 hours a day, manually collecting and developing EJM’s dataset. You can find more information about last year’s event here: [https://economics.ubc.ca/news/2020/vse-students-to-hold-workathon-to-raise-funds-for-anti-racist-queer-causes/#.YLf7ui2z1EI](https://economics.ubc.ca/news/2020/vse-students-to-hold-workathon-to-raise-funds-for-anti-racist-queer-causes/#.YLf7ui2z1EI)

To continue with the efforts of building a more inclusive UBC community, we have decided to run another Workathon this year. Recent events have compelled us to take action against the multifaceted nature of racism, misogyny, homophobia, transphobia, and biphobia which, even in its most subtle forms, contribute to conditions that permit overt discrimination and violence to occur. Although these challenges cannot be overcome within the span of a single news cycle, donation, or event, we hope to contribute to a vital conversation. All donations received this year will be directed to the following four organizations:

- Indian Residential School Survivors Society, [https://www.irsss.ca/](https://www.irsss.ca/)
- Downtown Eastside Women’s Centre, [https://dewc.ca/](https://dewc.ca/)
- Stop AAPI Hate, [https://stopaapihate.org/](https://stopaapihate.org/)
- Egale Canada, [https://egale.ca](https://egale.ca)

We, Alex Dong, James Yu, Jin Wang, and Soren Rajani, are students at the Vancouver School of Economics and currently work as research assistants to Professor Michael Peters. We want to draw attention to issues of race, ethnicity, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, and intersectionality, in particular, the impacts they have on students, faculty, and staff members, which must be discussed and evaluated by all of us. We hope that the Workathon contributes towards that ongoing process.

To increase awareness and raise funds for these anti-discrimination causes, we will be recruiting volunteers to work on EJM’s dataset for the three-day event. The volunteers will mainly be recruited from the Vancouver School of Economics at the University of British Columbia, along with some high school students. All participants of the Workathon are encouraged to collect as many data entries as they can. The joint efforts of the students will lead to a stronger positive impact over the community. 

To raise as much funds as we can for the organizations, we will be promoting the event with the help of UBC and VSE media. We, along with Professor Peters, will also be reaching out to potential donors (including faculty members, local businesses, and international corporations) who may be interested in supporting our causes.

By running the Workathon this year, we aim to fundraise for organizations that work to support First Nations peoples, Asian American and Pacific Islander communities, 2SLGBTQ+ communities, and self-identified women and children in need; and to complete a database that students and alumni can use to guide their plans for a career in Economics.
